# Graduate project
Repository which contains all information of my graduate project on persmissioned blockchains. 

## Structure
The graduate project is divided into several parts.

1. Literature survey.
2. Thesis proposal.
3. Experiment.
4. Thesis.

This repository is structured in the same way.

## Literature survey
The technique used in this survey is a mapping study which is outlined by (Petersen et al.).  They provides a process in which a scope  for gathering articles is defined, articles are gathered using a specific inclusion criteria, after which they are examined and the necessary data is extracted.
To view the survey go to `./dist/survey.pdf` .

Status: :pencil: Writing.

## Thesis proposal
A required proposal for admittance of the project as a Master Software Engineering graduate project. It provides answers to questions posed by the University of Amsterdam. Which help deciding whether the proposed graduate project is a appropriate project for the Master Software Engineering.
To view the survey go to `./dist/proposal.pdf` .

Status: :pencil: Writing.

## Experiment
Describes a controlled experiment to evaluate the validity of the Thesis's hypothesis.
To view the experiment go to `./dist/experiemnt.pdf`

Status: :triangular_ruler: Designing 

## Thesis
Documented form of the graduate project.
To view the Thesis go to `./dist/thesis.pdf`

Status: :triangular_ruler: Designing
