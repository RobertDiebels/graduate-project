# Graduate project
Repository which contains all information of my graduate project on persmissioned blockchains. 

## Structure
The graduate project is divided into several parts.

1. Literature survey.
2. Thesis proposal.
3. Experiment.
4. Thesis.

This repository is structured in the same way.

## Literature survey
The technique used in this survey is a mapping study which is outlined by (Petersen et al.).  They provides a process in which a scope  for gathering articles is defined, articles are gathered using a specific inclusion criteria, after which they are examined and the necessary data is extracted.
The survey was written using LaTeX. [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com)* was used as an online editing environment.
To view the survey go to `./survey/dist/survey.pdf` .

Status: :pencil: Writing.

## Thesis proposal
A required proposal for admittance of the project as a Master Software Engineering graduate project. It provides answers to questions posed by the University of Amsterdam. Which help deciding whether the proposed graduate project is a appropriate project for the Master Software Engineering.
The survey was written using LaTeX. [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com)* was used as an online editing environment.
To view the survey go to `./proposal/dist/proposal.pdf` .

*: Sharelatex is one of the best LaTeX editors I've found. They provide a comprehensive set of tools along with great [documentation](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn). They provide a free plan for projects with only 1 user if you wish to collaborate with others they provide specific [plans](https://www.sharelatex.com/user/subscription/plans)**.
